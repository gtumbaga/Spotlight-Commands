# Spotlight Commands


This is my collection of bash scripts saved as .command in order to be able to run them from spotlight.

#### Note:
In order to be able to run the .command scripts, the `Terminal` app needs to be added to the Privacy Accessibility.
- This can be done by going to `System Preferences` > `Security & Privacy` > `Accessibility`

It also might help to set the Terminal to automatically close the window upon completion
- This can be done by `Preferences` > `Profiles` > (Select a Profile) > `Shell`<br>
  on `When the shell exits` choose `Close the window`
